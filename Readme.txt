Implementin Some simple Shapes using C++ win32
in A1 it was required to draw 2 circle by filling their in between with circles and removing a quarter from all circles with 3 input clicks 
1-center of 2 circles 
2-Second one is a point on first circle
3-Third one is a point on second circle. 

in A2 it was Required to Draw a circle as a clipping window for 4 curves with inputs
1-2 clicks for drawing a circle 
2- 4 clicks for drawing a curve

in both assigments I used Bresenham Algorithm For circle
and the Output is Shown in a .jpg in both folders A1 and A2.
